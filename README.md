#Basketball Game Using Color Tracking

##About
This prototype basketball game was used for a work training.
It does not represent a complete working game; there are bugs, quirks, and missing features.

##Libraries Demonstrated

##Run
In order to run this project you need a web server running at the root directory.
I like to use [`live-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) for quick testing and live reload.
