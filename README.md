##Demo
https://coderfin.github.io/tracking-training/

##About
This prototype basketball game was used for a work training.
It does not represent a complete working game; there are bugs, quirks, and missing features.

##Libraries Demonstrated
- [tracking.js](https://trackingjs.com/docs.html#introduction)
- [matter.js](http://brm.io/matter-js/docs/)

##Run
In order to run this project you need a web server running at the root directory.
I like to use [`live-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) for quick testing and live reload.

### This code has only been tested in version 51 of Chrome on a MacBook Pro
