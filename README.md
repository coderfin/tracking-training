## About
This prototype basketball game was used for a work training.
It does not represent a complete working game; there are bugs, quirks, and missing features.

## Libraries Demonstrated
- [tracking.js](https://trackingjs.com/docs.html#introduction)
- [matter.js](http://brm.io/matter-js/docs/)

## Run
In order to run this project you need a web server running at the root directory.
I like to use [`live-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) for quick testing and live reload.

1) Download and install Node.js
    - https://nodejs.org
2) In Terminal (Mac) or Powershell (Windows) run the following commands:
    > \> cd { path/to/this/project }
    >
    > \> npm install -g live-server
    >
    > \> live-server
3) Open your browser to `https://localhost:8080`
